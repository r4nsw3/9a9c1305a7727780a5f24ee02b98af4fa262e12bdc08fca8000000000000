  |   - When matchmaking in Quickplay, the Format setting of your           |
  |   Preferred Rules will be more highly prioritized. This may cause       |
  |   matchmaking to take more time, and there's still no guarantee         |
  |   that you'll find a match that has your exact Preferred Rules.         |
  |                                                                         |
